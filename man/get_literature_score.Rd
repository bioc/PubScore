\usage{
get_literature_score(
  genes,
  terms_of_interest,
  gene2pubmed = FALSE,
  return_all = FALSE,
  wait_time = 0,
  show_progress = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{A vector with multiple genes.}

\item{terms_of_interest}{A list of terms of interest related to the topic you want to find the relevance for}

\item{gene2pubmed}{logical defining if gene2pubmed db is going to be used.
If used, the vector of genes has to be of HUMAN genes in the hgcn_symbol format.}

\item{return_all}{Only to be used with gene2pubmed! logical defining if the
all_counts table is going to be returned here. Usually it is generated by the
test_score function.}

\item{wait_time}{How long should be the interval between two requests to the ENTREZ database when it fails.
Defaults to 0. In seconds.}

\item{show_progress}{If TRUE, a progress bar is displayed. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, will display the index of the search occuring. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the literature scores.
}
\description{
Calculates the importance score for a given gene.
The importance score is the total counts of articles in the pubmed
database that are a result for that gene AND each term of a list
}
